# Simple OpenGL Renderer

Extremely simple OpenGL Renderer.
Inspired by [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) and early [Sparky](https://github.com/TheCherno/Sparky), but ported for Rust.

See example for usage
```bash
cargo run --example simple-3d
```

WIP:
* Textures
* Multiple lights
* Better lighting model (probably Blinn-Phong)
* Decide how to handle shaders (ship with presets vs extensible interface)
* Transform hierachy (thinking Unity style)
